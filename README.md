# 📖 Dev Chronicles

**Dev Chronicles** is more than a developer blog—it's a living codex of software engineering, a structured digital journal where **code meets reflection**. Built with **Vite + React**, it’s organized to guide developers and thinkers through the core pillars of modern development: **Frontend**, **Backend**, **DevOps & Cloud**, and **System Architecture**.

> *“Where thoughts, tools, and timeless principles of creation meet in one place.”*
